# Playbook
This is an example of moving, rotating, and scaling an object in 3D based on mouse dragging in 2D. Dragging the mouse is done via a ScreenPointToRay racast and the object's transform vectors are translated back using ProjectOnPlane and SignedAngle along with some Trig. This repo was originally created as a programming exercise for Playbook.
